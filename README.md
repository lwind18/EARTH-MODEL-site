# EARTH-MODEL-site
This site stores the models about the interaction between human activities and environment. 
This is the data processing codes for the paper published on the Science of The Total Environment (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720331946)
crop-simulation folder focus on the crop simulation, which I chose WOFOST model. 
The final soybean production also needs to calculate the model results and the count of the soybean cultivate area pixels.
